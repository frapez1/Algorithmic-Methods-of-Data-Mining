# This file contain the code for the first function "Find the Neighbours!"
# It takes in input:
#   - a node v
#   - One of the following distances function: t(x,y), d(x,y) or network distance 
#     (i.e. consider all edges to have weight equal to 1).
#   - a distance threshold d
# 
# Implement an algorithm (using proper data structures) that returns the set of nodes 
# at distance <= d from v, corresponding to vâ€™s neighborhood.
